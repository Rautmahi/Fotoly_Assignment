<h1>Image Carousel Catalog</h1> 
<br/>
 <h2>Overview</h2>
<br/>
<p> This is an image carousel catalog that displays a collection of images with details. The first image is displayed with its details on the right when the catalog is opened.
     The carousel includes a previous and next button, a play/pause icon button, and carousel indicators. The previous and next button allow users to display the previous or next image with details respectively. 
     <br/>
     Clicking the next button when the last image is showing will display the first image and clicking the previous button when the first image is showing will display the last image, cycling through the images.
<br/>
The play/pause icon button alternately starts and stops the automatic display of images in the carousel. The carousel automatically displays images for a 3-second interval, starting with the currently displayed image. 
<br/>Clicking on any carousel indicator or the previous or next button when the slideshow is active loads the appropriate image, and the slideshow continues from that image.
<br/>
Clicking on any thumbnail will show that image with details. The currently selected thumbnail image will be highlighted, and others will be in grayscale.
